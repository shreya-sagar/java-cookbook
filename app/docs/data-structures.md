# Data Structures in Java 

1. **Arrays**: A fixed-size collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

2. **ArrayList**: A resizable array-based implementation of the List interface that dynamically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed.

3. **LinkedList**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.

4. **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that supports push (add) and pop (remove) operations.

5. **Queue**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that supports enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) operations.

6. **PriorityQueue**: A queue-based data structure where elements are stored based on their natural order or a specified comparator.

7. **HashSet**: An implementation of the Set interface that stores unique elements using a hash table, offering constant-time performance for basic operations.

8. **LinkedHashSet**: A HashSet with predictable iteration order maintained by a doubly linked list.

9. **TreeSet**: A Set implementation that stores elements in a sorted tree structure, maintaining elements in sorted order.

10. **HashMap**: An implementation of the Map interface that stores key-value pairs using a hash table for fast retrieval.

11. **LinkedHashMap**: A HashMap with predictable iteration order maintained by a doubly linked list.

12. **TreeMap**: A Map implementation that stores key-value pairs in a sorted tree structure, maintaining keys in sorted order.

13. **Hashtable**: A legacy implementation of the Map interface similar to HashMap but synchronized for thread safety.

14. **Stack (java.util.Stack)**: A subclass of Vector implementing the Stack interface, providing synchronized stack operations.

15. **Vector**: A resizable array-based implementation of the List interface similar to ArrayList, but synchronized for thread safety.
